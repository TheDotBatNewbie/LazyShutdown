# LazyShutdown
HOW TO LET IT WORK?
Install the program on Windows 8 and higher and add it to the desktop. When you need it: double-click on the app, press any key, and only for this version, on the "You're about to be disconnected" message click close.
WHY DOESNT IT WORK?
Maybe, you're running it on iMac or any version that is lower than Windows 8 (example; Windows 7).
